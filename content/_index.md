# Hi, I'm John Doe

I'm a vibe‑coding fan and a friendly coder. I like building with curiosity and shipping with care. Right now I'm exploring a few LLM‑driven projects:

- LLM‑driven R&D team
- LLM philosopher
- LLM game, gambling, constellation experiments

If that sounds interesting, have a look around and check out my latest posts.
