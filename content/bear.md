## Bear

There's a website obesity crisis, with bloated scripts, ads, and trackers slowing down readers who just want to read.

This Hugo theme, inspired by Bear Blog, is the solution. It gives you a fast, optimized site that works flawlessly on any device, so you can focus on writing, not on a bloated website.

It makes it simple to publish content and grow an audience while keeping pages tiny, fast, and optimized for search engines.
