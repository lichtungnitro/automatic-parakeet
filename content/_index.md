## Vibe Blogging As a Service

I’m a vibe-coding enthusiast and a friendly coder. The word "vibe" serves as a reminder to return to the fundamentals of the world model. When I build with curiosity and ship with care, the model should be responsive to your requests—kind of like a form of _cyber-buddhism_, or at least that’s how I see it. I’m deeply attached to this philosophy. Right now, I’m exploring a few LLM-driven projects:

- [12-factor oriented logic](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents) agents development
- True language model philosopher who thinks
- LLM game theory and constellation experience

My life style can be simply described as:

- Stay **private**, try hard and dress well
- Eat healthy and talk **less**
- Do more, enjoy life **once**, be kind and stay humble
- Avoid drama, keep chasing and **embracing** results

If that sounds interesting and aligned to you, have a look around and check out my latest posts. You can find me with following methods:
