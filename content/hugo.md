# Hugo

Website: https://gohugo.io

Written in Go, Hugo is an open‑source static site generator available under the [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/LICENSE). It supports TOML, YAML, and JSON data files, Markdown and HTML content, and uses shortcodes for rich embeds. Notable features include taxonomies, multilingual mode, image processing, custom output formats, HTML/CSS/JS minification, and Sass/SCSS workflows.

Hugo builds on a variety of open‑source projects:

- https://github.com/yuin/goldmark
- https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma
- https://github.com/muesli/smartcrop
- https://github.com/spf13/cobra
- https://github.com/spf13/viper

Hugo is ideal for blogs, corporate sites, creative portfolios, online magazines, single‑page apps, or even sites with thousands of pages.

It’s for people who want to hand‑code their website without wrestling with complex runtimes, dependencies, or databases.

Sites built with Hugo are fast, secure, and can be deployed anywhere—AWS, GitHub Pages, Heroku, Netlify, or your own server.
