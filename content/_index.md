# Vibe Blogging As A Service

I'm a vibe‑coding fan and a friendly coder. Word vibe actually reminds us to return to foundamentalism of the world model. If I am building with curiosity and shipping with care, the model should be responsive to your request, which sounds like, hopefully, cyber-buddism. I am really attached to this
Right now I'm exploring a few LLM‑driven projects:

- LLM‑driven R&D team
- LLM philosopher
- LLM game, gambling, constellation experiments

My philosophy is imple which looks like:

- Stay private, work hard and dress well
- Eat healthy and talk less
- Do more, live life once, be kind and stay humble
- Avoid drama, keep chasing goals

If that sounds interesting, have a look around and check out my latest posts.
