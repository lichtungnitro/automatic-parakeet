## Unveiling gpt-oss: Pushing the Boundaries of Open-Weight Reasoning

OpenAI has announced a significant advancement in the field of AI with the release of `gpt-oss-120b` and `gpt-oss-20b`. These new open-weight language models represent a leap forward, offering state-of-the-art performance, remarkable efficiency, and robust safety features, all available under the permissive Apache 2.0 license.

### The Power of Openness: Performance and Efficiency

`gpt-oss-120b` and `gpt-oss-20b` are designed to democratize access to powerful AI capabilities. The `gpt-oss-120b` model demonstrates near-parity with OpenAI's `o4-mini` on core reasoning benchmarks and can operate efficiently on a single 80GB GPU. For developers and researchers prioritizing on-device deployment or resource-constrained environments, the `gpt-oss-20b` model offers comparable performance to `o3-mini` and can run on devices with as little as 16GB of memory.

These models excel in various tasks, including:

- **Reasoning:** Outperforming similarly sized open models on complex reasoning challenges.
- **Tool Use:** Exhibiting strong capabilities in function calling and integrating with external tools.
- **Efficiency:** Optimized for deployment across a wide range of hardware, from consumer GPUs to edge devices.
- **Context Handling:** Supporting context lengths of up to 128k tokens.

### Technical Backbone: Architecture and Training

Built on a Transformer architecture, these models leverage the power of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to manage their parameters efficiently. The `gpt-oss-120b` model boasts 117 billion total parameters with 5.1 billion active parameters per token, featuring 128 experts with 4 active experts per token across 36 layers. The `gpt-oss-20b` model, while smaller, features 21 billion total parameters, 3.6 billion active parameters per token, 32 experts, and 4 active experts per token across 24 layers.

They utilize advanced techniques like alternating dense and locally banded sparse attention patterns, grouped multi-query attention for inference efficiency, and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). The training data is primarily English, with a focus on STEM, coding, and general knowledge, tokenized using the `o200k_harmony` tokenizer, which is also being open-sourced.

### Post-Training and Advanced Reasoning

OpenAI has employed sophisticated post-training methods, including supervised fine-tuning and high-compute Reinforcement Learning (RL), to align these models with their internal **OpenAI Model Spec**. This process imbues them with strong Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and tool-use capabilities, mirroring the performance of their proprietary reasoning models. Developers can control the model's reasoning effort (low, medium, high) through simple system messages, allowing for a trade-off between latency and performance. Notably, the CoT reasoning is not directly supervised, encouraging research into monitoring and alignment techniques.

### Safety: A Foundational Priority

Safety remains paramount in OpenAI's model development. The `gpt-oss` models have undergone rigorous safety training, including filtering harmful data and employing **deliberative alignment** and the **instruction hierarchy** to refuse unsafe prompts and mitigate prompt injection attacks. OpenAI has also conducted adversarial fine-tuning and external expert reviews to assess risks, with findings detailed in their accompanying research paper and model card. To further bolster the safety of the open-source AI ecosystem, OpenAI is hosting a **Red Teaming Challenge** with a $500,000 prize fund, inviting the community to identify novel safety issues.

### Broad Availability and Ecosystem Support

The `gpt-oss` models are readily available for download on Hugging Face, with native quantization in MXFP4 for enhanced efficiency. OpenAI has partnered with numerous leading deployment platforms and hardware providers, including Azure, Hugging Face, NVIDIA, and AMD, to ensure broad accessibility and optimized performance. Reference implementations for PyTorch and Apple's Metal platform, along with example tools, are also provided to facilitate adoption.

### Why Open Models Matter

Open models like `gpt-oss` complement OpenAI's hosted API models by providing developers with greater flexibility for customization, fine-tuning, and on-premises deployment. They are crucial for fostering innovation, enabling safer and more transparent AI development, and lowering barriers for emerging markets and resource-constrained sectors. OpenAI believes that broad access to capable open-weight models promotes a healthier and more democratic AI ecosystem.

Developers are encouraged to explore these models via the **open model playground** and consult the provided guides for fine-tuning and deployment.
